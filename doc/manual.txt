This is a simple HandBook for FileZaar.

Introduction:
============
    FileZaar is a FileSharing Synchronizer backup tool much like DropBox(r).
It allows you to keep a copy of your files across different computers, having 
everythin replicated automatically and instantaneously. It is base on bazaar
the Open Source Disrtibuted Version Control System. It requires to parts: A 
local copy of FileZaar running on your computer, and a Centralized repository
(it could be your own or a third party as long as you have Read and Write 
capabilities over it). The process is simple, you keep a copy of a 
"repository branch" on your PC and that copy is monitored by FileZaar, each time
you create, delete or update a file or folder, this change is propagated 
automatically to your centralized branch) and it can be picked up later when you
start your filezaar in a different machine, as each time you start filezaar it 
checks for new changes on your local and centralized copy and it merges it. 
You can also configure this tho be done at a specific interval of time, or do 
it at will.

Notes:
=====
If you are running your own centralized repository you can use loggerhead to browse 
your,files https://launchpad.net/loggerhead

Check this copy of loggerhead I have installed:
http://190.210.45.241:8080/

Eventually this project will include a front end (probably based on loggerhead),
but for now loggerhead meets the needs pretty well.



Installing:
==========
Refer to the INSTALL FILE at the root installation directory.
